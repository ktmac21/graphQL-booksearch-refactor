## Description

In this week's homework my task was to refactor an existing functional Google Books API search engine web application built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server.
